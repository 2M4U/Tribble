# Tribble
Tribble is a discord.js payment bot based off of [discord.js-menu](https://github.com/jowsey/discord.js-menu) and [discord.js-menu-buttons](https://github.com/kalempster/discord.js-menu-buttons) that creates tickets and automatically validates payments. Tribble uses the Gmail API from Google to validate orders and confirm their validity.
